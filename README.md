# News Summary App
The News Summary App is a modern and lightweight web application built with React (Vite + TypeScript) and styled using TailwindCSS. It fetches real-time news articles from the GNews API and presents them in a clean and responsive interface.   The app includes powerful features like search with validation, category-based filtering, recent search storage (via Zustand + LocalStorage), and data display using TanStack Table and also using Formik and Yup.
